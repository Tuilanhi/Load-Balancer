Request
- contains a struct request
    1. string ip in
    2. string ip out
    3. int processingTime

WebServer
- 3 private member variables: 
    1. To tell if the server is currently processing a request (if it is not busy, it will ask for another Request)
    2. To keep track of the remaining processing time for the current request
    3. To store the current Request being processed
- has a constructor that initializes busy to false and processing time left to 0
- a getter function for busy to return whether or not it is busy
- a void function that accepts a Request and set busy to true, then sets processing time left to processing time of Request
- a void update function that decrement processing time left every time it is called. When processing time left is 0, busy is false.


LoadBalancer
- constructor that initializes the vector WebServers with num of servers, and int current time
- addRequest() accepts Request and add it to request queue
- distributeRequest() distribute requests from the queue to the servers. It gives a request to the server when the server is not busy
    - also update the minimum and maximum task time
- addServer() adds a webserver instance to the servers vector
- removeServer() removes a Webserver instance from the servers vector
- updateServer() updates each server by calling their update method and increment the current time.
    - The size of the request queue is checked. If the queue size exceed num of Servers * 5, a new server is added.
    - If the queue size falls below number of Server * 2 and there are multiple servers, a server is removed.
- getQueueSize() return the size of request queue
- getMinTaskTime() return the minimum task time
- getMaxTaskTime() return the maxinum task time

main()
- generate random ip helper function that random generates different ip
- helper function to generate random clock cycle of request processing time
- take in user's input for the number of servers and simulation time
- initialize the LoadBalancer and vector webservers with number of servers
- generate initial queue and create a Request and add it to LoadBalancer
- print out starting queue size
- set up a random number generator for adding in new Request
- create a main simulation loop that loops through the simulation time
    - calling LoadBalancer distributeRequest() and updateServer() 
    - add a Request at random time 
- print out ending queue size by calling LoadBalancer.getQueueSize()
- print out task time range
