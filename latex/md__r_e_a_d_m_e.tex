 This project will require the ability to create multiple Load Balancers, and a real-\/world implementations of a queue for each. We also need a struct, a lower-\/level data structure that allows data to be contained in an object (requests). Loadbalancers are available commercially, but in this project you will build one that has\+: ● Requests -\/ generates random IP addresses, both in and out, and random times for each request to be processed. This time can be considered clock cycles, so each request will likely take a minimum of 3 cycles. You do not have to use a system clock for this, an iterator is fine. o IP in o IP out o Time (integer) ● Webserver(s) o Receives requests from the Load Balancer o Process the requests o Asks for another ● Load Balancer o Queue of requests o Keeps track of time.
